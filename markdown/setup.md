## Hardware

I use a tower PC to do the heavy lifting and a laptop to work on the go.

My tower PC is specced as follows:

- 32GB DDR4 3200MHz RGB RAM
- 12 core/24 threads AMD Ryzen 7 3900X with a base/boost clock of 3800MHz/4800MHz
- 1TB WD SATA M.2 SSD
- 500GB Samsung Evo NVMe M.2 SSD
- 250GB SanDisk SATA 2.5" SSD
- Gigabyte RTX 2070 Super

Peripherals:

- Keyboard: Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2
- Mouse: Logitech G502
- Headset: HyperX Cloud II
- Monitor 1: 27" C27G1 144Hz 1080p
- Monitor 2: 24" BenQ 60Hz 1080p

And the laptop (a ThinkPad T15):

- 16GB DDR4
- 4 core/8 threads Intel Core i7 10510U
- 500GB NVMe M.2 SSD
- Integrated Graphics :(

My laptop runs Linux only and I dual boot Windows/Linux on my tower
to be able to play games.  All the real work is done on Linux tho as
I can't trust Windows to not hinder me when doing work.  If you want
a comparison and suggestion on which to use, look no further than
[(TODO)](/html/todo.html).
