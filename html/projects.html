        This list is by no means exhaustive or complete, but should give a rough
        outline about how I spend my programming time and efforts. If you are interested
        in projects summaries instead of detailed description, check out the corresponding github
        repository. Most of them (should) include a <code>README.md</code> which gives a nice overview
        of the project and how to build it.</p>

            <p>shedOS is the operating system I'm currently working on. It is written in C and uses a custom
            UEFI bootloader. Already implemented functions include basic things like loading, setting up an
            identity page map and registering interrupt handlers. I mainly follow random articles from
            <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org">wiki.osdev.org</a> and the YouTube tutorial series
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxN4E629pPnJxCQCLy7E0SQY_zuumOVyZ">How to Make an OS</a>
            from Poncho which I can highly recommend. There is still much to learn, so the codebase will certainly
            change a lot. My main goal is education and learning how things are done on the low level, not necessarily
            creating a usable kernel. Once I get further and manage to implement a proper userspace, I will add
            some useful tools, games and maybe port existing software to add at least some usability.</p>
