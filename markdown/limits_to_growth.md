    Limits to growth - the 30-year update
---

*Limits to growth - the 30-year update*, is the successor to the popular 1972
report *Limits to growth*. It was created by the Club of Rome, an organization
consisting of one hundred members selected from governments, UN administrators,
high-level politicians, diplomats, scientists, economists and business leaders.

It adresses issues concerning our growing resource
consumption and population. The findings presented by the book are more
relevant than ever before which is the reason why I want to introduce it here.

## Overshoot

The first thing we need to understand is the concept of *overshoot*. Overshoot
in this context means we exceed some kind of limit and it may appear in all
different forms. Examples include drinking more alcohol than the body can
metabolize, driving too fast on an icy road or turning the hot water faucet too
far. All of these things end in a mostly unpleasant result - but most often not
immediately. This is where *delay* comes into play.

The first condition that needs to be fulfilled is a rapid rate of growth of the
usage of the sources and sinks. In our world, examples can be found when taking
a look at economies and their pursue of growth. We see news talking about a 3%
binannual growth of the market which is almost exclusively tied to increased
resource consumption as well. Exponential growth is what makes overshoot so
insidious - most people have no intuition of its implications and dangers, as
we've seen in the ongoing pandemic.

Another thing that's necessary for overshoot to occur is a limit to overshoot.
In the context of our planet, these limits are divided into *sinks* and
*sources*.  Sinks refer to the capacity to absorb pollutants and waste like
nitrous oxide while sources refer to things like mineral oil, copper, or, more
abstractly, the capacity to generate usable energy.

```
+-------+     +-------+     +-----+
|sources| --> |economy| --> |sinks|
+-------+     +-------+     +-----+
```

The rate at which resources flow from the sources into our economy (with lots
of further flow paths) and then finally into the sinks is referred to as
*physical throughput*.

We may spend time in overshoot without actually encuring apparent damage. The
damage becomes visible only after a certain amount of time due to the nature of
the overshoot - when drinking too much, the alcohol first needs to be
metabolized down to products that actually hurt your body. In the same manner,
pollutants emitted into the environment take a certain amount of time to reach
a place in which they can become harmful. This is known as *delay*. Delay not
only occurs on the perception side, but also when trying to take action. It
takes time between a policy to replace old, inefficient boilers with newer,
more efficient ones.  Large-scale measures taken against pollution might take
decades to fully become effective.

To summarize: for overshoot to occur, we need

- rapid growth
- a limit to the growth
- delays in perceiving the limit and controlling the growth

## Real-world examples

Before we come to the model and its conclusions, let's take a look at some of
the examples given in the book. A good example is the story of the ozone hole
and of agricultural land.

In the mid-to-late twentieth century, *chlorofluorocarbons*, or CFCs for short,
were used by a lot of products like refrigerators or spray cans. At the same
time, scientists noticed unusually low readings of ozone levels in the upper
atmosphere. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms that is vital in
blocking harmful UV radiation. In regions with even one percent less ozone,
cases of skin cancer went up measurably. CFCs contain chlorine which destroys
ozone once it arrives in the upper atmosphere, but the chlorine itself is not
consumed. A single chlorine molecule can thus destroy multiple hundreds of
thousands of ozone molecules before it finally stops.

The good news is we've created laws around the world that prohibit
large-scale production and usage of CFCs so the ozone layer will slowly
regenerate over the next coming decades. But this process took a lot of
effort - the first report of CFCs being harmful to the ozone layer appeared in
1976, but the Montreal treaty to phase out CFCs appeared 11 years later, in
1987. A delay of 11 years, not including the actual time it took for companies
to switch off CFC production.

The ozone layer will heal completely, but its depletion has caused and still
will cause hundreds of thousands of cases of cataracts and skin cancer.

We lose around three million hectares of agricultural land each year due to
soil degradation and erosion. Yes, three million hectares, the size of Belgium.
Farmland can be regenerated by special agricultural practices, but lots of land
is **lost forever** and the rate at which land is lost is itself getting bigger.

The thing with overshoot is that after we've spent some time over the limit,
the actual limit itself decreases. This means in practice that we cannot return
to the limit we had before - by exploiting resources, we decrease the amount of
resources we can use sustainably in the long run. By staying in overshoot
longer, we degrade the resource base even more and make it unusable in the
future.

## The World3 model

The concept of sinks, sources and resource flows are rather abstract and need
therefore be backed by concrete models to allow us to make predictions. The
model used by the research team of *LTG* is called World3 and aims at modeling
the most important interactions between

- population growth
- industrial output
- pollution
- food
- resource base

These five indicators are called the *state of the world*.  Interactions
between them are modeled quite detailed, but still reside on a high layer of
abstraction.  The model does not concern itself with different geographic
regions or different kinds of foods or discriminates between different kinds of
industrial capital. Pollution for example is only divided into *short-term* and
*long-term*.

An example of the different interactions might be an increasing population
which leads to further food production. This increased food production uses up
a larger amount of the industrial output. Another core concept are *feedback
loops*. They are divided into *positive* and *negative* feedback loops. The
main feedback loops governing the model are population and industrial output.
They each come in positive and negative variants.

- positive: the higher the population, the higher the births per year (given a
  fertility rate)
- positive: the higher the industrial output, the higher the capital growth
  (given an investment rate)
- negative: the higher the population, the higher the deaths per year (given a
  mortality rate)
- negative: the higher the industrial output, the higher the capital
  depreciation (given a depreciation rate)

Negative and positive feedback loops often balance each other out, but their
strength depends on lots of other factors in the system.

Given a set of starting conditions, the model can create predictions for the
development in the twenty-first century. The state of the world is graphed
alongside two other categories.

- material standard of living
    - life expectancy
    - consumer goods per capita
    - food per capita
    - services per capity
- human welfare and footprint
    - human welfare index
    - human ecological footprint

Because the model is based on many assumptions and simplifications, it is
**not** meant to be used to make exact predictions - it cannot give the exact
life expectancy in 2067 or human welfare index in 2092. The thing it is good at
is revealing certain trends with reasonable certainty.

## The different scenarios

LTG presents ten different scenarios, each with different premises and
outcomes.  The two main outcomes are collapse and sustainability. Collapse is
characterized by a sudden decline of world population and industrial activity
as well as human welfare.

The other scenarios lie somewhere in between, but most produce collapse as a
result.

## Conclusion

The message is clear - we need to reduce our physical throughputs and protect
sources and sinks to stop the current overshoot. If we don't reduce them
willingly through policies, nature reduces them for us, with potentially
catastrophic consequences for our society. But a sustainable future in which
everyone can live a good life is possible. Lots of opportunities have already
passed and we have let decisions slip by that could have allowed us an even
better sustainable life, but we still have time to act.  Decisive and quick
changes are necessary in order to achieve this. We need to

- extend the planning horizon to base choices on long-term costs and benefits
- improve the signals to learn more about the impact of human activity on
  ecosystems
- speed up response times by having arrangements necessary to act effectively
  and swiftly
- minimize the use of non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and minerals
- prevent the erosion of renewable resources like soils and surface waters
- use all resources with maximum efficiency
- stop exponential growth of population and physical capital

Herman Daly has proposed three conditions a materially and energetically
sustainable society must meet:

- its rate of use of renewable resources do not exceed their rates of
  regeneration
- its rates of use of nonrenewable resources do not exceed the rate at which
  sustainable renewable substitutes can be developed
- its rates of pollution emission do not exceed the assimilative capacity of
  the environment

Lots of the underlying commitment to growth comes from trying to solve problems
in mainly three areas:

- povery
- unemployment
- unmet nonmaterial needs

Growth isn't solving these problems at all or only inefficiently.

Things we should do instead are

- sharing as there is enough for everyone to go around
- changing to an economic system that supports all people and shares work and
   industrial output equally
- finding nonmaterial ways to solve the need for self-esteem, challenge, joy,
   love, identity and community

It is our job to find solutions to these problems which don't rely on endless
physical growth.

A sustainable future is possible and desirable and will bring
with it a new age to humankind just like the agricultural and industrial
revolution did. Sustainability does not mean standstill. It means carefully
assessing when and where we need to use resources and stopping the
instrumentalization of our environment as a means to produce an ever-increasing
amount of goods.

## Opinion

The core issue raised by the report is one I complete agree with. Endless
physical, exponential growth in a finite world with finite resources is
impossible as we will reach a limit eventually. This is not something far in
the future, as we are already hitting hard limits in certain areas like a lack
of groundwater or arable land. We are also noticing the effects our waste
products have on the environment. By emitting an ever-increasing amount of
carbon dioxide, we accelerate climate change even more and exacerbate already
existing problems like flooding and droughts.

The concept of delay is also quite easy to confirm in the real world. Even if we
were to completely stop emitting CO2 right now, already emitted CO2 in the
atmosphere would warm the planet for the coming centuries nonetheless. We need
to act now because our actions take a long time to show effect and the longer
we wait, the more opportunities we miss. We will only take action once we reach
the point where droughts and floods hit us hard, where we are measurably
impacted by microplastics traveling up our foodchain etc. But we need to act
proactively, we need to *extend the planning horizon*. If we don't, lots of
industrial output will disappear or be locked in mitigating climate damage.

Are we too short-sighted to prevent collapse? This is a hard question to
answer. We will at one point or another need to transition to a net-zero
society, that's for sure. I think we will continue the pursuit of physical
growth and ever-increasing consumption at least for the next coming decades. We
hear of countries being swept away by rising sea levels and hundreds of
thousands of people dying due to multiple consecutive years of drought, but
still miss our goals of the Paris climate agreement. We probably won't take
action until the consequences are dire enough for our own lifestyle to be in
danger. Once we reach this point, the controlled transition to a sustainable
society becomes impossible.  Markets will crash, prices will soar and food will
become more scarce, even for us. Millions of people will flee from their
countries and increasing competition for fresh water supply instigates conflict
and wars. After a period of hardship, but not necessary collapse, we will
create new, international treaties to slowly transition into a true sustainable
society, but not without a sharp decline in human welfare beforehand. Reading
the IPCC reports only seem to validate this view even more.

You might have a more optimistic outlook of the future. Maybe the free market
will come up with some form of super-technology or a new generation of leaders
will take matters into their own hand before it is too late. Whatever the future
may bring, being prepared for the worst is not a bad idea.

I recommend reading LTG for yourself because I skipped on many important pieces
of information. The authors paint a more complete picture and while some parts
might be boring, they are essential to understand the whole message. The book
has been criticized for using wrongful premises or being overly sensitive to a
few input variables, but I think the overall message still applies. Like the
authors already said - World3 is just a model which cannot answer everything.
The right questions must be asked and the answers must be viewed with
skepticism, but the same must be done when people talk about being able to do
*business as usual*. Get as much information as you want and then find your own
conclusion. Who knows, maybe you are the one to correctly predict the future.
