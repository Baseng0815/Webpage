    Bastian Engel's Webpage

Welcome to my website. I share a lot about my personal projects
and endeavours here because it gives more freedom than using social media
and more choice than using pre designed web services. I have also taken care
not to use any scripts because only lunatics and webdevs would use scripts for a
static website.

I am a 21 year old CS student studying at the [Philipps-University of
Marburg](https://uni-marburg.de). I like programming, listening to music,
playing the piano and learning Japanese. One area I am especially interested in
is low level application development. You can find out more about my projects
[here](./projects.html). I also have an [image gallery](.//gallery.html)
and an [RSS feed](/rss.xml).

I will be spending the latter half of 2022 in
[Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mkiGMtbrPM) as an exchange student,
meaning lots of content can be found on the [2022 Japan
Blog](./2022_japan_blog).

Oh, and please notify me of any bugs. I regularly run scripts over this project
to keep everything nice and tidy, but things have broken in the past and I cba'd
to test each page every time.
