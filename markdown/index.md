# **Bastian Engel's personal website**

Welcome to my website. I share a lot about my personal projects
and endeavours here because it gives more freedom than using social media
and more choice than using pre designed web services. **This site does not
use any proprietary soyscript for your own convenience**

I am a 20 year old CS student at the
[Philipps-University of Marburg](https://uni-marburg.de). I like programming, listening to music,
playing the piano and learning Japanese. One area I am especially interested in
is low level application development like operating systems. That's why I'm using mainly C
nowadays to develop my own operating system.

You can find out more about my projects [here](html/projects.html).
