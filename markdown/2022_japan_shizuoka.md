title:
    Shizuoka
---

Our university organizes multiple trips each semester. The last time people
went to Ise shrine, but I didn't as I slept in late and all places were already
gone. Because the number of participants is limited and slots are distributed
on a first-come first-serve basis, I hurried to the International Office as
soon as classes ended to apply for the next trip whose destination was
Shizuoka, a neighboring prefecture which is known for its tea and Mt. Fuji.

## Arrival

We all met at the other dorm (*International House*), boarded two buses and
headed out towards Shizuoka at 8:30 in the morning. Shizuoka basically only
consists of hilly forest, so we passed through a lot of tunnels and over a lot
of bridges. Howl's moving castle was being screened in the bus, but I preferred
to listen to music and stare outside. The weather was beautiful too so you
could see really far.

## Tea picking

Shizuoka is known for tea. Green tea, to be specific. Our first stop was at a
tea museum/plantation thingy where we could pick our own tea leaves. As soon as
we entered the town, the only thing you could see was tea fields. Literally
every household had at least a small tea field in the garden, but there were a
ton of larger ones too. One thing that stood out were the countless small fans
guaranteeing proper air circulation above the fields. Tea picking was
interesting, but the quality of the leaves was bad as almost all of them were
nibbled on by insects.

I bought some tea-related souvenirs in their gift shop, namely a coke, some
maccha chocolate and some tea bags which'll hopefully last me through this
semester.

## Mt. Fuji viewing (or not)

Because we arrived quite late at the tea plantation, we only stayed for around
an hour before continuing our drive to Mt. Fuji for another hour. We stopped at
a small service area with a ferris wheel from which you could supposedly see
Mt. Fuji. The weather was really clear so our hopes were high, but the peak was
still covered by clouds.

## Return

We didn't have much time here either so after riding the ferris wheel, eating
lunch and visiting the gift shop, we returned by bus which took around three
hours. The bus journey itself was really relaxing as there was lots of scenic
nature. This might have also been the best part of the trip as the tea
plantation and ferris wheel were kinda boring. Overall, I'd rate the trip
mediocre since there wasn't much we experienced and 80% of the time was spent
inside the bus.
