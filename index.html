        <p>Welcome to my website. I share a lot about my personal projects
        and endeavours here because it gives more freedom than using social media
        and more choice than using pre designed web services. <b>This site does not
        use any proprietary soyscript for your own convenience</b>.</p>
        <p>I am a 20 year old CS student at the <a href="https://uni-marburg.de">
        Philipps-University of Marburg</a>. I like programming, listening to music,
        playing the piano and learning Japanese. One area I am especially interested in
        is low level application development like operating systems. That's why I'm using mainly C
        nowadays to develop my own operating system.</p>
        <p>Visit the links above to find out more about my projects, what software I use
        and so on and so forth.</p>
