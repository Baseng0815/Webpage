NUFS has a buddy program which you can join before going to Japan. You'll be
assigned a few Japanese students who are supposed to be your *buddies* and help
you in case of trouble, show you around interesting spots or just become your
friends. What people make of it really depends on you liking them or not. In my
case, I met them in October for the first time and we went to Inuyama, a city
in northern Aichi.

## Shopping street

The area we were in was kind of traditional, with lots of Japanese-style shops
on each side of the road. We went around for a bit and found a good-looking
restaurant where we ate lunch. There was also the entrance to Inuyama castle
which we visited afterwards.

We wandered around the streets, got something to drink and explored the area
before finding something to eat.

Lunch was really tasty. I had Kishimen (flat noodles with rough edges) noodle
soup, rice, some side dishes and Sake which filled me up completely and,
thinking about it now, might've made the climb up the castle even more
difficult than it already was.

## The castle

After waiting in line for a few minutes and taking off our shoes, we entered
the castle which was way smaller than expected. It had four floors connected by
very steep stairs which, although easy to climb for me due to my size, meant
even more physical exertion. The ceiling was really low too so I had to
basically crawl up the stairs. After reaching the top floor and going on the
outside balcony, we were greeted by a beautiful view of the city and
surrounding area. It was a bit scary too due to the railing reaching only up to
my knees and the floor being slippery with only socks on.
