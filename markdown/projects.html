        <h1><strong>My Projects</strong></h1>  <p>This list is by no means exhaustive or complete, but should give a rough outline about how I spend my programming time and efforts. If you are interested in projects summaries instead of detailed description, check out the corresponding github repository. Most of them (should) include a <code>README.md</code> which gives a nice overview of the project and how to build it.</p>
