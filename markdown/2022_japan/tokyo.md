I've spent four days/three nights in Tokyo from 2022/10/06 (Thu.) to 2022/10/09
(Sun.) together with a friend, exploring some famous and also lesser-known
places of the metropolis.

## Day 1

Our classes on Thursday ended at 12:20, after which we went to Nagoya station
and bought two-way Shinkansen tickets for Tokyo. Even though we applied a 20%
student discount, it was still quite expensive, costing us around Â¥20 000
(~â‚¬140) each. Paying the money was worth it though as this was my first
Shinkansen trip during daytime and you could actually see the landscape
breezing by.

The Shinkansen ride took 90 minutes and I spent the time writing up some posts
and enjoying a lunch set I bought at Nagoya station.

We arrived at Akihabara station at around 17:00 as our hotel was there.
Interestingly, we only paid like Â¥20 000 for three nights and two adults for a
prime location which was reeeeally cheap, probably because the country was
still in lockdown at the time and almost no tourists came there. The hotel was
called Hotaku btw, which makes a lot of sense for a hotel in Akihabara. Our
room was more like an apartment with two twin-sized beds, a toilet, bathroom
and even a small kitchen with a gas stove which we didn't use.

<figcaption>And a pretty nice one too (breathing simulator again)</figcaption></figure>
</div>

After relaxing some time at the hotel, we headed out to explore Akihabara and
to find something to eat. We didn't explore any stores because it was already
late and most businesses close at around 20:00, but it was still weird walking
between ten-story buildings plastered with anime stuff and getting approached
by girls in maid costumes.

## Day 2

The second day wasn't that exciting. It was raining quite a lot so we spent
most of the time inside anime merch stores, checking out figures and
second-hand books and comics. We had a quick breakfast at Danny's and roamed
around Akihabara the whole day, me buying some weird food isekai manga I've yet
to read. We also took a look at some doujin stores.

## Day 3

The third day began with us visiting the Tokyo Skytree, a tower standing at 634
meters which serves as a telecommunications broadcast and observation tower.
Going up took over a minute, but the view was beautiful and really puts into
proportion the enormous urban sprawl the Kantou region has undergone.
Surprisingly, there even was a cafÃ© and an area full of Gacha machines.

Our next stop was Ueno park where we just walked around aimlessly and enjoyed
the landscape.

<figure><img src="../res/tokyo/d2_ueno_koen_3.jpg" alt="pagoda" />
<figcaption>There was also a shrine</figcaption></figure>

We also went to Shinagawa which is famous for its giant pedestrian crossing and
bustling commercial districts.

Leaving Shinagawa, it was quite late already so we headed to our last stop
which was Shinjuku. We dropped by to see the imperial gardens which
unfortunately were closed at the time so we walked around and enjoyed the
beautiful view of walls. We also went past the british embassy.

Shinjuku is one of the major nightlife and club districts of Tokyo. We roamed
around the area for a bit and then decided to head off to a more quiet place as
there were too many people and most of the bars were too touristy and
expensive. We found a small Izakaya around 15 minutes by train away, had dinner
and went back to our hotel.

<figcaption>This fried stuff was sooo good</figcaption></figure>
</div>

## Day 4

Plans for the fourth and therefore last day were kind of short as we had our
Shinkansen ride back booked for 18:00. We went to a Maid cafÃ© to get lunch and
spent the rest of the day exploring the Pokemon center and various smaller
stores.

## The end

This concludes my little four-day trip to Tokyo. Even though it's the largest
metropolitan area in the world, it doesn't feel that crowded apart from the
trains and hotspots. In particular, the lack of car horns felt weird as people
here generally don't use it as freely as people back in Germany do.

If you enter a side alley, you can find lots of small, family-owned restaurants
and pubs which are, in my opinion, way cooler than any of the fancy places in
e.g. Shinjuku. We even got approached by some white-collar workers, striking up
a conversation in English and even treating us to some *Sashimi*.

I might have spent a bit too much time in Akihabara as I really liked the stuff
they had there, but I also visited lots of other places. If I were to go to
Tokyo again, I'd probably check out more of the nightlife and maybe visit a
club and talk to some locals.
