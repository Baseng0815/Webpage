    Kyoto

Although most people don't know much about Japan, almost everyone has heard of
Kyoto, the cultural hub of Japan with a rich history and old buildings and
shrines as it was mostly spared from the destruction of WW2. We only spent two
days there so we weren't able to visit a lot, but we still saw some interesting
places and experienced a lot.

## Arriving at Kyoto

Kyoto is close to Nagoya, so it took us less than an hour to get there by
Shinkansen, even though we rode the slower Kodama.

## The rest of the first day

We had a reservation at a Kimono rental place to get changed into traditional
clothing. As we were already running late and the buses were too full to board,
we hurried along a riverbank and arrived just in time.

After lunch, we walked around for a while and visited Kiyomizudera, a famous
temple, located in the south of Kyoto. It took some time to get there and
unfortunately, we didn't go all the way up and only saw the entrance. The
surrounding town was really nice though and we spent some time strolling
around.

## The second day

We started our second day off by going to Arashiyama, a huge bamboo forest
located in the northwest of Kyoto.

After Arashiyama, we went to Kinkakuki, the golden temple. I don't know what it
was used for or if it is even made out of real gold, but it looked really nice
and had lots of beautiful and natural landscape next to it.

Finding something to eat afterwards was unexpectedly hard as there were too
many restaurants to choose from, but we decided on one specializing in
*Omuraisu* which is basically rice topped by an omelette with other stuff
around. I got the extra-large mushroom version which was was too much, but I
somehow managed to finish it all.

Returning to the Ryokan later that day, we took a short break and then went
drinking in a nearby Izakaya. The place was looking run-down and we hesitated
at first due to us being the only people there, but the food was really good
and we had a great time.

## The way back

Because our train back was leaving fairly early, we went to the station at
around 10:00, exploring the surrounding area. Kyoto station is definitely one
of the nicest stations I've ever been to since it's really open and has a cool
stairway that lights up, an observation deck with a nice view, a sky bridge and
lots more.

Although we didn't have much time and sprinted from place to place, the
experience was definitely worth it. I plan on coming back here though as we
just didn't have enough time to savor all the nice things Kyoto has to offer.
Trying out a kimono and ‰∏ãÈßÑ - wooden sandals - was a nice experience too which
I will definitely **not** repeat cause it was waaay too hot and these sandals
just hurt and make it hard to walk.
