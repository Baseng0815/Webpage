Welcome to my website. I share a lot about my personal projects
and endeavours here because it gives more freedom than using social media
and more choice than using pre designed web services.

I am a 20 year old CS student studying at the [Philipps-University of
Marburg](https://uni-marburg.de). I like programming, listening to music,
playing the piano and learning Japanese. One area I am especially interested in
is low level application development. You can find out more about my projects
[here](/html/projects.html). I also have an [image gallery](/html/gallery.html).
