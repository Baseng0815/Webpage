## Room

I live alone in a small apartment in an eight-story apartment complex. It's
called Global Village and is one of the three dormitories of NUFS, besides the
International House and NUFS-NUAS-residence. NUFS itself as well as the nearest
convenience store and supermarket can be reached in five minutes by foot.

We are around 70 people this year and, aside from a few
Japanese resident assistants (RA's) and the administrative staff, only
international students live here. Although my room is way smaller than what I
had back at home, I still like it as it has everything I might need and I can
shut the door to work (or laze around) completely undisturbed.

The apartment is divided into two; a small entry area from which the bathroom
can be entered and the main room. There's not really much to say about either
of them, the bathroom has a toilet, a mirror that's hanging way too low for me,
and a bathtub/shower combination. It's kinda small, but I don't spent much time
there anyway so that's not a problem.

The main room has a bed with bedding included, an open shelf, a wardrobe and a
desk with drawers. There's also a small balcony attached which probably makes
smokers really happy, but I use it to dry my stuff and glance outside at the
highway running right next to the dorm. It's really loud outside, but the
windows are new so they isolate pretty well.

Rent is really cheap at 250 Euros/month with utilities included. I get around
100 Mbit/s from the WiFi network, but there's also a LAN socket next to the
desk which I might try out in the future. It's also interesting to note how
Japanese doors work: the key turns in the exact opposite direction as in
Germany and you turn the key once and then turn it BACK again to remove it.

## Kitchen

You may have noticed that my room doesn't include a kitchen. This is no problem
though as we have shared communical kitchens across each floor. Each kitchen
has four workspaces and two refrigerators divided between everyone including
multiple tables in the center so you always have enough room to work. Shared
appliances include two rice cookers, two microwaves (電子レンジ/denshi renji in
Japanese - sounds really funny imo), four induction stoves and a small oven to
make toast. Oh, and we also have an electric water heater which is essential
for my daily cup ramen dinner. Each workspace has a sink and a private drawer
where you can put stuff like kitchen-/tableware or non-refrigerated
ingredients.

We don't have a dishwasher unfortunately which, in combination with weird
garbage rules like needing to wrap every. single. piece. of food stuff and
waste into a plastic bag before throwing it away, makes cooking more
complicated stuff annoying quite quickly.
