# **My Projects**

This list is by no means exhaustive or complete, but should give a rough
outline about how I spend my programming time and efforts. If you are interested
in projects summaries instead of detailed description, check out the corresponding github
repository. Most of them (should) include a `README.md` which gives a nice overview
of the project and how to build it.
