## shedOS dev stream announcement for Sat, 2021-11-06 19:00:00+01:00

I will be streaming this saturday (2021-11-06) starting at 19:00:00+01:00
open-ended, probably for around 6 hours. The goal is picking up shedOS again and
finally getting crude scheduling to work as well as getting the grasp of how
to implement a basic VFS and system call API. You can find my twitch
[here](https://twitch.tv/basti153).
